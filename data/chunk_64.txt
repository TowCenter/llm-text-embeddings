And 10 of Eric's fellow warriors from that incredible night of victory will also be receiving medals at a private ceremony that will soon be held at the White House, and Eric, you'll be there. Thank you. Thank you, Eric. That's a big one. Tonight, We've celebrated many truly extraordinary American patriots, but there is one last living legend to honor before we go. He is one more heroic American aviator, navy fighter pilot Royce Williams served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, flying more than 220 missions. In the skies over Korea in 1952, Royce was in the dogfight of a lifetime, legendary dogfight. Flying through blizzard conditions, his squadron was ambushed by seven Soviet fighter planes. It was his first aerial combat of the war and despite being massively outnumbered and outgunned, Royce led the takedown of four enemy jets and almost destroyed the others, vanquishing his adversaries while taking 263 bullets to his own plane and being seriously hurt. His story was secret for over 50 years. He didn't even want to tell his wife, but the legend grew and grew. But tonight, at 100 years old, this brave Navy captain is finally getting the recognition he deserves. He was a legend long before this evening. Royce, please stand up and I will ask the First Lady of the United States to present Captain Royce Williams with his Congressional Medal of Honor. Gilroy said, thank you, Eric. I've always wanted the Congressional Medal of Honor, but I was informed, I'm not allowed to give it to myself and I wouldn't know why I'd be taking it. But if they ever open up that law, I will be there with you someday. But, you know, that's our highest honor, Congressional Medal of Honor. And that's a big thing and it's an honor to be in the same room with you. Thank you both, very much, Eric, thank you. Thank you.
