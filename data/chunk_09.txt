And this year, and I must say, I got them both. I got them in my first term and I was disappointed because I didn't think I'd be the president when this happened. But strange things took place and now I've got them because I got the Olympics and I got the 2026 FIFA World Cup and I wanted to claim the 250th, but I didn't get away with that one. [Laughter] I couldn't claim that one for myself, but we're getting the World Cup, so we have the World Cup and the Olympics coming and that is exciting news. So this will be a year to celebrate our country and the heroes who have kept it free, men like Buddy Taggart. At age 17, Buddy volunteered to defend America in World War II, serving in the Pacific under the great General Douglas MacArthur. He fought bravely in the famous Battle of Manila, worked so hard. He was badly wounded and almost killed by enemy machine guns in Luzon. And 81 years ago this month, he liberated the largest internment camp in the Philippines, one of the largest anywhere in the world. But he earned many honors, including a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star, came home started a family and tonight he is in the gallery looking forward to July 4th, 2026, his 100th birthday. So Buddy, you're a brave man and we salute you. Even in times of challenge, setback and immense heartache, the spirit of 1776 has always shown through very brightly. It was July 4th of last year when flood waters tore through a girls' summer camp in central Texas, one of the worst things I've ever seen. I was there. Rising 26 feet in the matter of minutes, tragically claiming many, many lives. You all remember that one. As the waters threatened to sweep her away, 11 year old Millie Kate McClelland closed her eyes and prayed to God. She thought she was going to die. Those prayers were answered when Coast Guard rescue swimmer Scott Ruskin descended from a helicopter above.
