You know, I asked Michael Dell, how do you make all that money? He said, well, I just sat in my dorm in school, and I made computers and I'd sell them to people. And I just kept selling and selling and selling and pretty amazing story. That's called the American Dream. He sold a lot of computers, a lot of those laptops. So, I congratulate him on that, but I really thank him and Susan, as well as others like Brad Gerstner a very tremendous guy. He was behind it right from the beginning, Brad Gerstner. Thank you, Brad.
