And students and educators in every state have joined the First Lady's efforts in the presidential AI challenge, keeping America's next generation positioned to succeed and strongly succeed in the future. Tonight, we welcome two young people whose lives reflect the First Lady's impact, Cierra Burns and Everest Nevermont. Thank you both. And Melania, thank you. I know how hard you worked on it. Thank you very much. I'm very proud to say that during my time in office, both the first four years and in particular this last year, there has been a tremendous renewal in religion, faith, Christianity and belief in God, tremendous renewal. This is especially true among young people, and a big part of that has -- had to do with my great friend Charlie Kirk, a great guy, great man. So, last year Charlie was violently murdered by an assassin and martyred, really martyred for his beliefs. His wonderful wife Erika is with us tonight. Erika, please stand. Thank you, Erika -- been through a lot.
