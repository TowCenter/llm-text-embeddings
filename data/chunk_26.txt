Stories like this are why last month I signed executive order to ban large Wall Street investment firms from buying up in the thousands, single-family homes. And now I'm asking Congress to make that ban permanent because homes for people -- really, that's what we want. We want homes for people, not for corporations. Corporations are doing just fine, Rachel, thank you very much. Good luck with your home. You'll get one soon.
