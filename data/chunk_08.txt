I'm also pleased to say that the next time the Olympic torch is lit, it will be here in America for the 2028 Olympics and it's the summer version right in Los Angeles. We're going to do a good job in Los Angeles. And Los Angeles is going to be safe just like Washington DC is now one of the safest cities in the country.
