One of the brave service members who helped achieve this stunning turnaround was 20-year-old West Virginia Army National Guard Specialist, Sarah Beckstrom. After a four-month deployment, she voluntarily extended her service, and her rank was going to be lifted. She was doing so well. They were so proud of her. But the very next day she was on patrol near the White House when she was ambushed and shot in the head by a terrorist monster from Afghanistan, shouldn't have been in our country. And all because she wore the uniform of our nation, she was shot. He traveled here because he didn't like people wearing our uniform, he was sick and deranged. Shouldn't have been in our country. Sarah Beckstrom died in order to defend our capital. And we are honored to be joined by her wonderful parents. Gary and Evalea, your daughter was a true American patriot, and she will be greatly missed. She was a great person. I saw reports on her; they've never seen anything like it. So sorry, thank you very much. A great young lady.
