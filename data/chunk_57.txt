You know, they put it on my desk. We got the money from tariffs and other things, a lot of money we have. We have much more money than people understand, have to rebuild that program a little bit, but it won't take long. But we got the money and it was $1,775 and they wanted my approval. And I said what's the number. $1,775. I said, wait a minute, for one more dollar we can have 1776. It's going to -- I said we're going to figure that out. I never asked anybody if we could afford it. One more dollar, I said $1,776. And I said that's good. And I'll tell you what, our military -- that was four months ago, our military, I never see a person in the military that doesn't thank me for it. So, we're honored to do it. They deserve it and we call it $1,776, It was great. And we love our military; we love our law enforcement. We love our firemen, you know the firemen don't get mentioned enough. We love our firemen. We're also restoring American security and dominance in the Western Hemisphere, acting to secure our national interests and defend our country from violence, drugs, terrorism and foreign interference. For years, large swaths of territory in our region, including large parts of Mexico, really large parts of Mexico, have been controlled by murderous drug cartels. That's why I designated these cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, and I declared illicit fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction. And with our new military campaign, we have stopped record amounts of drugs coming into our country and virtually stopped it completely coming in by water or sea. You probably noticed that. We very seriously damaged their fishing industry also. Nobody wants to go fishing anymore.
