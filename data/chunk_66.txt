From the rugged border towns of Texas to the heartland villages of Michigan. From the sun kissed shores of Florida to the endless fields of the Dakotas. And from the historic streets of Philadelphia to right here in our nation's capital, Washington DC, the Golden Age of America is upon us. The revolution that began in 1776 has not ended; it still continues because the flame of liberty and independence still burns in the heart of every American patriot. And our future will be bigger, better, brighter, bolder and more glorious than ever before. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.
