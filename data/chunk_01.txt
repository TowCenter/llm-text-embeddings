And you've seen nothing yet. We're going to do better and better and better. This is the golden age of America. When I last spoke in this chamber 12 months ago, I had just inherited a nation in crisis with a stagnant economy, inflation at record levels, a wide open border, horrendous recruitment for military and police, rampant crime at home and wars and chaos all over the world. But tonight, after just one year, I can say with dignity and pride that we have achieved a transformation like no one has ever seen before and a turnaround for the ages. It is indeed a turnaround for the ages. And we will never go back to where we were just a very short time ago. We're not going back today. Today, our border is secure. [Audience chants "USA"] Thank you. Today our border is secure, our spirit is restored, inflation is plummeting, incomes are rising fast, the roaring economy is roaring like never before and our enemies are scared. Our military and police are stacked and America is respected again, perhaps like never before. After four years in which millions and millions of illegal aliens poured across our borders totally unvetted and unchecked, we now have the strongest and most secure border in American history by far. In the past nine months, zero illegal aliens have been admitted to the United States. But we will always allow people to come in legally, people that will love our country and will work hard to maintain our country. The flow of deadly fentanyl across our border is down by a record 56 percent in one year. And last year the murder rate saw its single largest decline in recorded history. This is the biggest decline, think of it, in recorded history -- the lowest number in over 125 years. Year 1900, in fact substantially before my wonderful father -- I had a wonderful father, Fred -- before he was born, substantially before he was born. That's a long time ago. He wouldn't like me to say that. But that's a long time ago.
