American oil production is up by more than 600,000 barrels a day and we just received from our new friend and partner, Venezuela, more than 80 million barrels of oil. American natural gas production is at an all-time high because I kept my promise to drill baby drill. More Americans are working today than at any time in the history of our country. Think about that, any time in the history of our country, more working today and 100 percent of all jobs created under my administration have been in the private sector.
