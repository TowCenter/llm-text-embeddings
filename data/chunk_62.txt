But the deeds of one warrior that night will live forever in the eternal chronicles of military valor, Chief Warrant Officer Five, Eric Slover, planned the mission and was the flight lead in the cockpit of the first helicopter. A big, beautiful, powerful helicopter, it was a massive Chinook carrying, as you can imagine, many, many American warfighters. Wearing the dog tags his wife Amy had blessed with holy water before he left, she knew it was going to be a rough one. Eric steered the Chinook under the cover of night and descended swiftly upon Maduros' heavily protected military fortress. This was a major military installation protected by thousands of soldiers and guarded by Russian and Chinese military technology.
