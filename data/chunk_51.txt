And I want to thank Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner for your help. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Jared. And I also want to thank the man they report to, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Thank you, Marco. People like you. You know, Marco got 100 percent of the votes when he was in -- I think our next one was about 54 percent. And some of the Democrats are now saying, I can't believe we approved that guy. [Laughter] And he said, it's an honor that they feel that way, right, Marco? You have done a great job, great secretary of state. I think he'll go down as the best ever. Under the ceasefire, I negotiated every single hostage, both living and dead has been returned home. Can you believe that? Nobody thought it was possible. Nobody thought that was possible.
