I saw reports that were like perfect. She was perfect. Serving alongside Sarah that day was Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe. The terrorist shot Andrew in the head, and no one thought he could possibly make it. The two of them, Sarah and Andrew, both shot violently in the head, neither was expected to make it. They weren't even given a chance, except his wonderful mother named Melody who I spoke to the same night, and she was so positive. The doctors thought that Andrew was gone, but his mother said no, no, Mr. President, Andrew will be fine. He's going to make it.
