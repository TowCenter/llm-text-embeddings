We ended DEI in America. We cut a record number of job killing regulations and, in one year, we have lifted 2.4 million Americans, a record, off of food stamps. And for all of these reasons, I say tonight, members of Congress, the state of our Union is strong. Our country is winning again. In fact, we're winning so much that we really don't know what to do about it. People are asking me, please, please, please, Mr. President, we're winning too much. We can't take it anymore. We're not used to winning in our country. Until you came along, we were just always losing, but now we're winning too much. And I say no, no, no, you're going to win again. You're going to win big; you're going to win bigger than ever. And to prove that point -- to prove that point, here with us tonight is a group of winners who just made the entire nation proud. The men's gold medal Olympic hockey team, come on in. [Audience chants "USA"] Go ahead. That's the first time I've ever seen them get up. [Laughter] And actually, not all of them did get up. But they beat a fantastic Canadian team in overtime, as everybody saw -- as did the American women who will soon be coming to the White House. They were in the Oval Office before and I just want to say a second, very big congratulations to Team USA. But I have to say that -- and I told them this and we took a vote of the team. I said, anybody votes no, I'm not doing it. So they stood there and they weren't about to say no, because I've never seen a goaltender play as well as goalie, Connor Hellebuyck. Think of it, 46 shots on goal. And I asked him, the one shot, the one where you put your stick in the back and it hit the neck of your stick and bounced off, do you practice that, or was that a little lucky? [Laughter] He refused to answer that question.
