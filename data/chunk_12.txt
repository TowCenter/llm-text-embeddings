Recently in Pennsylvania, I met Megan Hemhauser, a devoted mom who home schools her children -- beautiful, two children -- during the day while waiting tables at night as her husband works overtime operating very heavy equipment. Megan is here this evening and she's happy to tell you that she is so, so much richer because, with no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and our expanded child tax credit done again by Republicans, Megan and her husband will take home more than $5,000 extra just for the year cutting her tax bill in more than half. Megan, please stand up. We're fighting for you, Megan. Thank you. Thank you, Megan. We're fighting for you, Megan. Under our bill parents like Megan can also activate their children's brand-new Trump Accounts and I didn't name it. I didn't name it. I did not name that. Nobody believes me, but I did not name it. It was named by a very tall man sitting right there in the third row. Nice man, a good man. Tax free investment accounts for every American child. This is something that's so special and has taken off and gone through the roof. Millions will be prefunded courtesy of the US Treasury and private individuals like Michael and Susan Dell, who have donated $6.25 billion to fund the Trump Accounts for 25 million American children. They're great people.
