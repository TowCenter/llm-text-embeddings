Many, if not most, illegal aliens do not speak English and cannot read even the most basic road signs as to direction, speed, danger or location. That's why tonight I'm calling on Congress to pass what we will call the Delilah Law, barring any state from granting commercial driver's licenses to illegal aliens. And yesterday, as you probably saw at the White House, I hosted a ceremony with Americans who lost their treasured loved ones to the scourge of illegal immigration. People came into our country -- how we allowed this to happen with our open borders. These are the Angel Moms and Families that for decades our government betrayed and our media totally ignored -- totally. It was terrible, hard to believe actually.
