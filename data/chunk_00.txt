Well, thank you very much, everybody. It's really an honor. Speaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, First Lady of the United States. Second lady of the United States. Members of Congress and my fellow Americans, our nation is back, bigger, better, richer and stronger than ever before.

This July 4th, we will mark two and a half centuries of liberty and triumph, progress and freedom, in the most incredible and exceptional nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth.
