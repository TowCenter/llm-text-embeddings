I'm asking this Congress to pass tough legislation to ensure that violent and dangerous repeat offenders are put behind bars and, importantly, that they stay there. Starting last summer, I deployed our National Guard and federal law enforcement to restore law and order to our most dangerous cities, including Memphis, Tennessee, big success; New Orleans, Louisiana, big success; and our nation's capital itself, Washington DC where we have almost no crime anymore in Washington DC. How did that happen? In fact, crime in Washington is now at the lowest level ever recorded, and murders in DC this January were down close to 100 percent from a year ago. They don't like to hear that. One of the -- sick people.
